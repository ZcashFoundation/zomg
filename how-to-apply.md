# How to apply

**Please take the time to review this entire page before submitting an application.**

* If your grant is approved you will have to go through a Know Your Customer (KYC) process and sign legal documentation with the Zcash Foundation prior to receiving any funds.  
* Applications can be submitted anytime but will be reviewed on a every other week basis. 
The larger the requested sum the more likely the ZOMG will require more time to evaluate your proposal, as well as requiring more milestone payouts.
* [Here is a wishlist of things we may fund](https://zcashomg.org/what-we-fund.html), though the list is not exclusive it should directly apply to Zcash.
