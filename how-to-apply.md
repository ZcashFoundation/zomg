# How to apply

Interested in applying for a grant from ZOMG? **Please take the time to review this entire page before submitting an application.**

* If your grant is approved you will have to go through a Know Your Customer (KYC) process and sign legal documentation with the Zcash Foundation prior to receiving any funds.  
* Applications can be submitted at any time, but they will be reviewed on a rolling basis, approximately once every two weeks. 
* The larger the requested sum, the more time we may require to evaluate your proposal, and funding will be divided into several milestone-based payouts.
* [Here is a wishlist of things we want to fund](https://zcashomg.org/what-we-fund.html). This list is non-exclusive, but your project should apply directly to Zcash or its ecosystem.
* You can read about our selection process [here](https://zcashomg.org/selection-process.html)

2. If you receive a _no_, your application will be closed on the grants platform and an explanation will be posted on your forum thread.  
3. If you receive a _yes_ to continue, ZOMG may request improvements to your application and perform additional due diligence. For example, we may ask outside experts to weigh in on technical aspects your project, or we may ask you for more information about your project, background, or experience. You may also be required to add milestones tied to incremental payouts to assure project follow through.
4. ZOMG will vote during its bi-weekly meetings for a final approval or rejection of your grant. We strive to make this process as fast as possible while maintaining adequate due diligence. Our bi-weekly cadence means your application could be approved or rejected in just a few weeks.

If you are approved for a grant, congratulations! You will be put in touch with the [Zcash Foundation](https://www.zfnd.org/) to gather your payment details and complete the required KYC documentation.
