# How to apply

Interested in applying for a grant from ZOMG? **Please take the time to review this entire page before submitting an application.**

* If your grant is approved you will have to go through a Know Your Customer (KYC) process and sign legal documentation with the Zcash Foundation prior to receiving any funds.  
* Applications can be submitted at any time, but they will be reviewed on a rolling basis, approximately once every two weeks. 
* The larger the requested sum, the more time we may require to evaluate your proposal, and funding will be divided into several milestone-based payouts.
* [Here is a wishlist of things we want to fund](https://zcashomg.org/what-we-fund.html). This list is non-exclusive, but your project should apply directly to Zcash or its ecosystem.

If you are not sure you are ready to submit an application, please feel free to post your idea to the forums in the [Grants](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/Grants/33) category to solicit feedback. You can tag @ZOMG on the forums to ask questions. 

## Steps to apply

2. After you submit your application, it will be put into a queue to await moderator approval. Once your application is approved by a grants platform moderator, you will receive an email notification with a public link to your application. 
3. When you receive the notification that your application is public, please post a link to it on the [Zcash Community Forum](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/Grants/Applications/36) in the "applicants" category. This step is to gather community feedback about your project.

3. If you receive a _yes_ to continue, ZOMG may request improvements to your application and perform additional due diligence. For example, we may ask outside experts to weigh in on technical aspects your project, or we may ask you for more information about your project, background, or experience. You may also be required to add milestones tied to incremental payouts to assure project follow through.
