# How to Apply

**Before submitting your application please note:**

* If your Grant is approved you will have to go through a Know Your Customer (KYC) process and sign legal documentation with the Zcash Foundation prior to receiving any funds.  
* Applications can be submitted anytime but will be reviewed every two weeks. 
The larger the sum you are requesting the more likely the ZOMG will require more time to evaluate your proposal as well as requiring more milestone payouts.
* Be sure your project fits as [one of the things we fund](https://zcashomg.org/what-we-fund.html) else it will quickly be rejected.
* You can read about our completed internal evaluation process HERE (link to new evaluation process page needed)
