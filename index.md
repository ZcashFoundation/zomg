## About ZOMG

ZOMG (Zcash Open Major Grants) exists to fund projects that advance the usability, security, privacy, and adoption of Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency. 

Formerly known as the Major Grants Review Committee, ZOMG was created by community members of the Zcash cryptocurrency in [ZIP 1014](https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014), working within the Zcash governance process.

ZOMG’s funds come from the decision in ZIP 1014 to allocate a portion of all newly created Zcash —over a four year period—to the ZOMG. 

Grants are chosen by a committee of [five members](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/inaugural-post-in-mgrc-updates/37410) who were chosen by the [Zcash Community Advisory Panel](https://www.zfnd.org/governance/community-advisory-panel/) in an [open election](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view).
